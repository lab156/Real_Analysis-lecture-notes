A lot of what we will see in this class is about Banach spaces. Banach spaces are complete normed vector spaces.

\begin{ddef}[Equivalent Norms]
We say $\Vert\ \Vert_1$ and $ \Vert\ \Vert_1$ are equivalent iff:
$(\exists \ c,C>0)(\forall\ x\in V)$
$$c\Vert x \Vert_1 \leq \Vert x \Vert_2 \leq C\Vert x\Vert_1$$
\end{ddef}

\begin{teorema}
In $\RR^n$ (finite dimension) all $p$-norms are equivalent:
$$|x|_\infty \leq |x|_p \leq |x|_1 \leq n|x|_\infty$$
Note that $n$ is the best constant in this case.
\end{teorema}

\begin{remarks}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item On a Finite dimensional space, any two vector norms are equivalent.
    \item A norm $\RR^n$ is uniquely determined by its \emph{unit ball} $B=\{x\from |x| \leq 1 \}$.
    \end{itemize}
\end{remarks}

The following result specifies what are (all?) the possible unit balls:
\begin{teorema}
    If $B$ is any 0-symmetric \emph{Convex Body} in $\\R^n$, then $B$ is the unit ball for some norm.

    (In this context, body means a compact with nonempty interior set.)
    \begin{proof}
        Note that the convexity is necessary, for example, to guaranty the triangle inequality. If $|x|,|y|\leq 1$ then convexity implies:
        $$|(1-t)x+ty| \leq (1-t)|x| + t|y| \leq 1$$
    \end{proof}
\end{teorema}
