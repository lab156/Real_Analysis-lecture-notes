\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item To check that such a sequence exists, first note that for all $n\in \NN$ there exists $x_n\in \HH$ such that:
$$\Big| |\inprod{Tx_n}{x_n}| - \v T\v\Big|<\frac 1n$$
If this was not the case, then there would be a smaller upper bound for $\{ \inprod {Tx}x\from \v x\v=1\}$ contradicting the definition of the norm.
Next, since the closure of $TS=\{Tx\from \v x\v =1\}$ is compact (in the metric topology), we can assert that $(Tx_n)$ has a limit point $y$.
Thus, there is a subsequence of $(Tx_n)$ that converges to $y$ in the norm.
 
\item
