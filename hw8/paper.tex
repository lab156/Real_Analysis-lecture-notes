First we prove that $\RRR(T)^\perp = \NNN(T^*)$. Let $y\in \RRR(T)^\perp$; this means that for all $x\in \HH$ we have:
$$\inprod {Tx}y=0 = \inprod x{T^*y}$$
Since $x$ can take any value, let it be $x=T^*y$ then:
$$\inprod {TT^*y}y=0 = \inprod {T^*y}{T^*y}=\v T^*y\v^2$$
This means that $\RRR(T)^\perp \subset \NNN(T^*)$.

On the other hand, if $y\in \NN((T^*)$ then $T^*y=0$, and this means that $\forall x\in \HH$:
$$0=\inprod x{T^*y} = \inprod {Tx}y $$
Thus $y\in \RRR(T)^\perp$ and this enables us to conclude that $\RRR(T)^\perp = \NNN(T^*)$.

Secondly, we show that $\overline{\RRR(T^*)}^\perp = \NNN(T)$. Since  $T^{**}=T$, and $T^*$ is just another linear operator we can say:
$$\RRR(T^*)^\perp = \NNN(T)$$
Taking perpendicular complements on both sides and using that $(E^\perp)^\perp$ is the smallest closed subspace that contains $E$
$$\overline{\RRR(T^*)}= \NNN(T)^\perp $$
Note that the closure is necessary, as the range of even continuous linear operators may fail to be closed; to wit: take $T\from \ell_\infty \to \infty$ and $x\in \ell_\infty$ defined as:
$$T(x) = \left( \frac{x_j}{j} \right)_1^\infty$$
Then $\v T \v=1$ and the image is not closed\footnote{This example is from: http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/305503/what-are-the-range-and-the-norm-of-this-bounded-linear-operator}

Assuming $T$ is invertible, first let us suppose that $T^*=T^{-1}$. Then $\forall x,y\in \HH$ we have the following:
$$\inprod{Tx}{Ty} = \inprod x{T^*Ty} = \inprod xy$$
Thus, $T$ is unitary.

Now let us suppose that $T$ is a unitary map (we are still assuming it is invertible). 
We will show that $\v y - T^*Ty\v=0$ 
\begin{gather*}
\v y - T^*Ty\v^2=\inprod{y- T^*Ty}{y- T^*Ty}\\
=\inprod yy - \inprod y{T^*Ty} - \inprod {T^*Ty}y + \inprod{T^*Ty}{T^*Ty}
\end{gather*}
Which is zero since a unitary map preserves the inner product. 
Since exactly the same procedure can be done to prove that $\v TT^*y- y\v=0$; we conclude that $T^*=T^{-1}$.
