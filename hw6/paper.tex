First,  define a seminorm on $C^\infty(\RR)$:
\begin{equation}
p_m(f)= \sup_{x\in [-m,m]} \left\{ \frac{|f^{(k)}(x) |}{k!} \from k\in \NN \right\}\label{p.def}
\end{equation}
First, we check that $p_n$ is defined for every $f\in C^\infty(\RR)$ using the Cauchy Estimate for the $k-$th derivative:
$$ |f^{(k)}(x) | \leq \frac{M_R k!}{R^k}$$
In this case $R=2m$ and $M_R$ exist because $f$ in continuous and $[-m,m]$ is compact. 
Then, the  $f^{(k)} $ will be bounded by:
$$\frac{|f^{(k)}(x) |}{k!} \leq \frac{M_R}{(2m)^k}$$
We conclude that the supremum in (\ref{p.def}) always exists.

Now we can check that the functions $p_n(f)$ are in fact seminorms. 
Nonnegativity, and Homogenuity, is garanteed because the supremum is taken from the absolute value of the $k-$th derivative of the function.
For the triangle inequality, we check that:
\begin{align*}
p_m(f+g) & = \sup_{x\in [-m,m]} \left\{ \frac{|f^{(k)}(x) + g^{(k)}(x)  |}{k!} \from k\in \NN \right\}\\
&\leq \sup_{x\in [-m,m]} \left\{ \frac{|f^{(k)}(x) |}{k!} +\frac{|g^{(k)}(x) |}{k!}  \from k\in \NN \right\}\\
&\leq p_m(f) + p_m(g)
\end{align*}

Now we show that the family of seminorms defined before is compatible with the given definition of convergence. To this end, suppose that for all $k\in \NN$ and on all compact sets, $f^{(k)}_n \xrightarrow{unif.} f^{(k)}$. Then $\forall \epsilon >0, \ \forall k\in\NN,\ \forall m\in\NN,\ \exists N$ such that $n\geq N$ implies:
$$\sup_{x\in [-m,m]} \left\{ \frac{\left| f_n^{(k)}(x) - f^{(k)}(x)\right|}{k!}\right\} < \epsilon\, k!$$
