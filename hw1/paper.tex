    \item[Problem 1] Usually $\vesp\times \vesp$ is given the product topology, which is given by the norm $\max(|v_1|,|v_2|)$, for instance. Now, let $epsilon>0$; take $\delta=\epsilon/2$, then $\forall \, x,y\in \vesp$ let's denote $z=x+y$ we see:
    $$    \max(|x-x_0|,|y-y_0|) < \epsilon/2 \implies |z-z_0|< \epsilon $$.
    Note that this is \emph{uniform continuity}.

    For the scalar multiplication of $a\in K$ and for $\epsilon>0$ take $\delta=\epsilon/a$.

    To prove that $|\Vert x \Vert - \Vert y \Vert | \leq \Vert x-y\Vert$, note that 
    $$\Vert x + y -y \Vert \leq \Vert x+ y\Vert + \Vert y \Vert$$
    this gives $\Vert x\Vert - \Vert y \Vert \leq \Vert x-y\Vert$, reversing the argument gives the other order.
\item[Problem 5] Let the subspace be denoted $A$ and its closure by $\bar A$. For all $x,y \in \bar A$; there are  sequences $\{x_i\},\ \{y_i\}\subset A$ converging to $x,y$ respectively. This means that both $ax$ and $x+y$ are in $ \bar A$ since $\{x_i+ y_i\}\to x+y$ and $a\, x_i \to a\, x$. Also note we proved these two operations are continuous above.
    \item[Problem 13] We  need to check two things: that $\Vert x\Vert=0$ implies that $x\in \MM$ and that the norm is well-defined. Starting with the latter, note that if $x~y$ then there exists $z\in \MM$ such that $x=y+z$. Thus, $\Vert x\Vert \leq \Vert y\Vert$ and $\Vert y\Vert \leq \Vert x\Vert$.
